# How Do?

## Dependencies

These dependencies are required for the makefile to run:

1. [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)
    > Ubuntu: `sudo apt install make`
    > Or alternatively: `sudo apt install build-essential`
2. [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
    > Ubuntu: `sudo apt install python3-poetry`
3. [Curl](https://curl.se/)
    > Ubuntu: `sudo apt install curl`

## For new projects

1. Make a new folder where you want the project to reside.
2. Create a file called `Makefile` and copy everything from `Makefile` into it.
3. Run `make init`.
